# mbm - Mosman Bandwidth Manager

Portifolio/Legacy code. Developed a long long time ago...

This project was one of the latest versions, just before I move all efforts to new VirtexAdmin https://github.com/andreimosman/virtex and later to https://github.com/andreimosman/virtex-ng

I think that this version was made to run on FreeBSD, instead of the previous versions that runs on OpenBSD.
